## Why You Should Avoid Authorization Code Generators and Rapidshare Downloads
 
Authorization code generators are programs that claim to generate valid codes for activating Adobe Photoshop CS3 Extended or other software products.

Moreover, using an unauthorized code can violate the software license agreement and result in legal consequences.
 
Rapidshare is a file-sharing service that allows users to upload and download files from other users.
